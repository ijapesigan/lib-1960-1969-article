  abstract = {In the absence of a sufficient number of a priori substantive assumptions ruling out certain conceivable causal linkages among variables, neither cross-lagged correlation nor any other technique for analyzing 2-wave, 2-variable panel data will yield a unique causal inference. A wide variety of distinct linear causal models will always be compatible with a given set of panel data.},
